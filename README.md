Initially, the main objective was to develop a script that can identify lithofacies in the core log lithology column. The identification is based on the colour scheme incorporated in the provided log. An electronic copy of the lithofacies core logging form was provided on May 9, 2018. It is to our understanding that the lithofacies core logging form was prepared using Adobe Illustrator and does not contain any visually evident
document control identification pertaining to the layout used.
Additionally, the script was expanded to identify the unconformities and flooding surfaces. The scope also extended to cover template matching to identify the various symbols in the sedimentary structure col-umn and the depositional environments.
