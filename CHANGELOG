20191006 - Version 09
Precision is user defined to create the number of decimal places in LAS File. Defined in the GUI.
New numbering convention for the facies.

20190412 - Version 08
Has a user interface.
Supports PDF with more than one page.
Will process every page of the PDFs that have more than one page.
The colors and RGB are managed in external files. Meaning it is a standard text file where you could just go in and add the colors in the text and match them to the corresponding Facies name.
The scripts read the PDF file info.
The script will terminate (skip the PDF) if it can not find any fonts.
The script will keep looping till it is able to identify a Pixel ID where the colors (Lithology & Grain Size) can be identified and processed accordingly.

20180910 - Version 06
The identification of the scale is now automated.
The script uses OCR to identify the depth and the depositional environment.
Fixed issue with different size (length) logs.
Fixed issue of description spanning to the extremities of the log.
Change in algorithm of the script.
Vigorous quality control measures.
Parsing OCR data.
Return facies code.

20180724 - Version 05
PDF conversion is completely housed within the script.
Code optimization. Split into different modules.
Modules run for different pixel columns as defined.
Identifies deposition bedding type.
Adjust scale based on DPI.
Code optimization. Algorithm changed.
Changed colours in terminal outputs.
PDF split into MediaBOX to obtain higher resolution images during template matching.
Template matching functional.
Write Sediment and Environment to CSV.
Code optimization. Algorithm changed.
Added the colour code of the matching templates overlay to the Python terminal output.
Scaling template from 90% to 110% to look for possible matches.
Fixed issue with different size (length) logs.
